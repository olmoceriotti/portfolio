In this project I worked on implementing heterogenous graph neural networks in PyTorch Geometric to work on EASG, a novel annotation frameworks for egocentric videos. The task tested was the one of action prediction. More on this work [here](https://github.com/olmoceriotti/HetGnn-ActionPrediction-EASG).
